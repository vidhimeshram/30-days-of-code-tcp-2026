  <h1 class="aboutMe">About ME</h1>
  <p class="about">I am a passionate web developer with a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with hands-on experience in modern frameworks like React.js. I actively practice data structures and algorithms, which has sharpened my problem-solving skills and improved my logical thinking.<br><br>

  I believe in learning by building, and I work daily on improving my coding skills through real-world projects and consistent problem solving. Along with core web technologies, I continuously explore new tools and best practices to grow as a developer and create efficient, user-friendly applications.
